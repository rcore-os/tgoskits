# ax-task Linux v7.1 PREEMPT_RT Audit

## Status and scope

This document is the audit ledger for the task-system migration on
`codex/refactor-ax-task-from-1596`.

The audited base is `origin/dev` at
`37c8f60e81b135c7d997c39630410db418ee192d`. The base already contains the
Starry PID lifecycle fix from PR #1706. Its generation-specific
`ProcessIdentity` and `Live -> Zombie -> Reaping -> Reaped` transition remain
the sole authority for PID visibility and reaping.

The initial branch head is
`962d057785624994d365ea33bb27fdfe0b24ce75`. The range changes 462 files. Every
path in that range is assigned to one of the areas below. Driver work is
limited to drivers and IRQ adapters already changed by the range, plus the
minimum adjacent runtime boundary needed to repair them.

Files that were already large on `dev` are not mechanically split because one
call site changed. New files, substantially expanded files, and objects that
own unrelated concurrency or lifetime invariants must be split by reason to
change.

## Reference configuration

The semantic reference is the local Linux `v7.1` checkout at commit
`8cd9520d35a6c38db6567e97dd93b1f11f185dc6`.

The reference configuration is generated outside that checkout:

```text
CONFIG_NO_HZ=y
CONFIG_HIGH_RES_TIMERS=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT=y
CONFIG_PREEMPT_DYNAMIC=y
CONFIG_EXPERT=y
CONFIG_SMP=y
CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y
```

The relevant Linux sources are:

- `kernel/sched/core.c`, `fair.c`, `rt.c`, and `deadline.c`;
- `kernel/locking/rtmutex.c`, `rwsem.c`, and `spinlock_rt.c`;
- `kernel/time/hrtimer.c`, `clockevents.c`, and `tick-oneshot.c`;
- `kernel/irq_work.c`, `kernel/softirq.c`, and architecture IPI handlers;
- `kernel/events/core.c`;
- `kernel/exit.c`, `kernel/fork.c`, and `fs/exec.c`;
- `drivers/tty/serial`, `net/core/dev.c`, and the corresponding IRQ adapters.

Linux is prior art for state ownership and ordering. TGOSKits does not copy
Linux object layout, per-CPU implementation, or callback APIs when those would
violate the crate dependency boundaries.

## Audit matrix

| Area | TGOSKits range | Linux reference | Required invariant | Initial finding |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Scheduler placement | `components/ax-task/src/system`, scheduler policy and thread state | `kernel/sched/core.c` | A thread has one checked placement; migration and switch-tail publication cannot expose two owners | `queued_cpu`, `running_cpu`, `on_cpu`, and `migration_target` are independent fields with many hand-written updates |
| Remote delivery | ax-task CPU remote inbox, task-work, ax-runtime IPI glue | scheduler IPI, `irq_work` | Publish payload and epoch before IPI; consume the delivered epoch before admitting a new notification | Busy/claim and boolean doorbells lack complete new-publication race coverage |
| Task deadlines | ax-task timer, park, wait and deferred deadline paths | `hrtimer.c` | Hard IRQ handles bounded value records; cancellation and expiry cannot dereference released owners | The heap stores raw timer-node pointers whose safety depends on caller serialization |
| Physical clockevent | ax-runtime clockevent and platform generic timer | `clockevents.c`, `tick-oneshot.c` | One per-CPU owner; infinity is not a numeric deadline; hardware conversion clamps to min/max delta | `u64::MAX` can truncate during tick conversion, overdue events can program zero, and no offline transition exists |
| Context switch | ax-runtime task/guard and per-architecture context code | scheduler `on_cpu`, `finish_task_switch` | Scheduler baton spans the complete switch; outgoing resources remain live until switch tail clears `on_cpu` | The invariant exists but is spread across oversized runtime modules |
| PI and sleep locks | ax-task PI, ax-sync mutex, scope-local | `rtmutex.c`, `rwsem.c` | Registration, deboost and grant form one bounded transaction; no unbounded spin with preemption disabled | PI unlock waits for registrations by spinning; waiter and lock identities lack generation-based reuse protection |
| IRQ wake lifetime | `IrqWaitCell`, Starry future/wait adapters | `synchronize_irq`, completion/wake queues | An IRQ-visible registration is revoked and quiesced before its owner is freed | Starry `IrqNotify` publishes a raw pointer to retained wake storage |
| Process lifecycle | starry-process and Starry task/process glue | `exit.c`, `forget_original_parent`, `do_wait` | PR #1706 identity owns exit/reap; relationship updates have one lock order and one publication transaction | Reparent and retire can acquire children/group locks in conflicting orders |
| Perf ownership | Starry perf task, hardware and sampling paths | `kernel/events/core.c` | `pid == 0` is a task context; `pid == -1` with a CPU is a CPU context; teardown executes on the owner CPU before storage release | CPU-local sampling slots are registered and removed on the current CPU and contain raw notify pointers |
| Generic timers | Starry POSIX timers and AxVM timer worker | hrtimer soft/threaded callbacks | Arbitrary callbacks run in task context; earlier deadlines use a bounded wake endpoint | Worker design exists and must remain separate from ax-task task deadlines |
| Serial and driver IRQ | rdif-serial, some-serial, ax-runtime serial, changed vsock/USB adapters | serial core, NAPI/event publication | IRQ endpoint only reads/acks/drains a bounded amount and publishes stable events; workers advance flow | Endpoint separation exists but changed paths still require lock, allocation and ownership audit |
| Architecture idle | axcpu idle primitives and trap glue | architecture idle entry, especially LoongArch `genex.S` | IRQ enable plus idle is atomic with pending-work recheck; an interrupt in the enable/idle window returns after the idle instruction and is still dispatched | LoongArch follows the Linux return-address pattern but lacks injected timer/IPI window tests |
| Compatibility | ax-api, ax-posix-api, axstd, Starry syscalls and axvm callers | Linux UAPI and project compatibility contracts | Internal APIs may change; Linux ABI, errno and axstd observable behavior do not | The migration spans many adapters, so compile-only validation is insufficient |

## Confirmed red evidence

GitHub Actions run `30330320261`, job `90184755449`, and a local full
aarch64 `qemu/system` run both fail immediately after
`STARRY_PERF_FREQ_OK`. The page fault instruction is at the
`ThreadWakeHandle::wake` entry and the receiver contains released-memory data.

The failure chain is:

1. a system or self sampling event registers a slot in the current CPU's
   registry;
2. the task migrates before disable or drop;
3. teardown removes the slot from the new CPU rather than the owner CPU;
4. the old CPU retains an active slot containing a stale IRQ notification
   pointer;
5. a later PMU interrupt dereferences the released wake registration.

Individual perf cases can pass because they do not force this cross-test,
cross-CPU lifetime. The fix must model task and CPU perf targets explicitly;
the SMP perf tests must not be skipped or affinity-pinned to hide the defect.

## Completion rules

Each confirmed defect receives a deterministic failing test at the lowest
useful layer before its fix. Pure source moves are exempt but must preserve the
same test results.

A phase is complete only after its affected packages compile, their tests and
feature clippy checks pass, formatting is clean, and `git diff --check` passes.
Full QEMU runs occur only at subsystem milestones. A QEMU failure is first
reduced to a grouped subcase or deterministic virtual-runtime test before
another full run.

Every confirmed finding inside the range is fixed. A pre-existing issue
outside the agreed range is recorded separately with evidence rather than
silently expanding the refactor.
